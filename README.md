# Yelp Clone

This week at Makers Academy we were introduced to Rails and using MVC frameworks to create web applications. 

The project included testing with Rspec and Capybara and using AJAX for front end.

The specifications for restaurants on Yelp clone are:

- Visitors can create new restaurants, specifying a nmae and rating
- Restaurants can be edited and deleted
- Visitors can leave reviews for restaurants
- The homepage displays all reviews along with the average rating for each restaurant
- Validations must be in place for the restaurant and review forms

Users on the Yelp clone website can:

- Register/login
- Must be logged in to create restaurants
- Can only leave one review per restaurant
- Can delete their own reviews

To view tests, run;

```sh
$ rspec
```

To open in the browser start the server and visit localhost/3000;

```sh
$ bin/rails s
```
